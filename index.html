        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza">Pizza</a> is our most popular dish on the menu because of our classic home made sauce!</p>
        <p>Our Chicken Cutlet Sandwiches are one of the best you will ever try! We use organic ingredients to give you the most nutritious and best tasting sandwich possible.</p>
        <p>Our tasty Chicken Tenders are also one of our best dishes! They are cooked using Vegetable Shortening for the best flavor possible in a fresh chicken tender.</p>
        <p>For dinner, Lasagna is a great choice! Our home made lasagna includes beef from cows raised in farms where they are treated well, and we use the same sauce in our lasagnas that we use for our pizzas!</p>
        <p>One of the restaurants owner's personal favorite is the chicken parmesan! Our chicken parmesan includes a deep fried chicken breast that is topped with mozzarella cheese and traditional tomato sauce, then cooked in the oven for 4 minutes.</p>
        <p>Our steaks can be cooked at the temperature you prefer, but our steaks are seared on a pan and slowly cooked using garlic butter.</p>
        <p>Our First desert ever was the Tiramisu. It was a huge success with many five start reviews! Our sweet and soft Tiramisu is a desert that will never let you down.</p>
        <p>Another highly rated desert is our Chocolate Mousse Cake. This desert is highly desired by the younger guests at our restaurant because of its sweetness and taste that no other desert can immitate.</p>
        <p>Our final item on the desert menu is a loved classic, ice cream. We make our ice creams in house with dextrose sugar for great tasting for all of our flavors.</p>
